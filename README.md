lockstep
========

This is a project to explore the replication of resources, such as files in a distributed system using the concept of a shared system memory, utilizing services like ZooKeeper or FireBase, or in cases where speed is not so significant, a simple database.  The initial focus is to build a synchronization client for synchronizing files in two directories that can be on different machines.
